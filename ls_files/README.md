# Life Science Journey in NUS (2019 - 2023)

**About this page**: This is just documentation of my NUS journey as a Life Sciences Major. I hope these pages and insights helps students currently are studying (or are considering) Life Sciences as a major. As usual, whatever I say in these pages are of my own opinions and words should not be treated as gospel, you should still do your due diligence :).
