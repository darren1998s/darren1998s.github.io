# Matplotlib: Basic Plotting

Matplotlib is a mathematical library which allow us to bring life to data and translate them into graphs which tells us a story.

Some of these graphs are more complex compared to others and depending on what you would like to show would imply different items.


First, we would need to import the library into our python interpreter which allows us to utilise it:

```python
import matplotplt as plt
```
Supposed that we would like to make a plot between 2 variables, we would required the usage of two arrays. For this example, we would have array X and Y containing three variables each. 
```python
X = [1,2,3]
Y = [1,2,3]
plt.plot(x,y)
```
